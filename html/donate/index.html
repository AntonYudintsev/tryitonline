				<p><em>Try it online!</em> is currently running on a low-end VPS, which I'm paying for out of my own pocket. While processing power seems to be plenty for the time being, the SSD is starting to fill up and memory is constantly low.</p>
				<p>With your help, I hope to be able to afford a better VPS. This would not only ensure a smooth operation of the service; it would also allow me to implement some new features, such as short permalinks with code stored on the server side.</p>

You'll get $10 in DO credit for using my referral link and, as soon as you spend the minimum amount on their products, I'll get $25 credit myself to help cover my server costs.</p>
